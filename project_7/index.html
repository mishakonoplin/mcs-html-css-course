                <div class="name">Meta Side Table</div>

                <div>The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited to all communal living spaces
                    and
                    bedrooms. Consisting of a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s
                    appearance changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full depending on the viewing angle.
                    Featuring multi-directional storage for your reading material and an even top for decorative
                    accessories.</div>

                <div class="name">Click Shelf</div>

                <div>Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and construction, as well as the visual
                    lightness, form the aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel, a
                    girder and shelves, the system functions similar to a construction kit. Only four screws fix the
                    girder
                    together to which the shelves are simply hung up without any tools. The material and precision of
                    the
                    components guarantee the stability and assembly.</div>

                <div class="name">Float Shelf</div>

                <div>Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to diverse interpretations –
                    holding a
                    book as a bedside or side table, bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine collection,
                    serving
                    as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding small personal essentials as a hallway tray. The Float
                    Shelf
                    equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation and boardinghouses.
                    Embodying
                    purity at its most elegant degree, the strict geometry of this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a
                    sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels cut from a single sheet of
                    aluminum,
                    with a simple two-fold composition allowing for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the
                    reduced aesthetic principles of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the essence
                    of a
                    shelf.</div>
